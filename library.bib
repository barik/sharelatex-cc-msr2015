	abstract = {In recent years several tools and methodologies have been developed to improve the dependability of spreadsheets. However, there has been little evaluation of these dependability devices on spreadsheets in actual use by end users. To assist in the process of evaluating these methodologies, we have assembled a corpus of spreadsheets from a variety of sources. We have ensured that these spreadsheets are suitable for evaluating dependability devices in Microsoft Excel (the most commonly used commercial spreadsheet environment) and have measured a variety of feature of these spreadsheets to aid researchers in selecting subsets of the corpus appropriate to their needs.},

@inproceedings{Chen2013,
abstract = {Spreadsheets contain a huge amount of high-value data but do not observe a standard data model and thus are difficult to integrate. A large number of data integration tools exist, but they generally can only work on relational data. Existing systems for extracting relational data from spreadsheets are too labor intensive to support ad-hoc integration tasks, in which the correct extraction target is only learned during the course of user interaction. This paper introduces a system that automatically extracts relational data from spreadsheets, thereby enabling relational spreadsheet integration. The resulting integrated relational data can be queried directly or can be translated into RDF triples. When compared to standard techniques for spreadsheet data extraction on a set of 100 random Web spreadsheets, the system reduces the amount of human labor by 72\% to 92\%. In addition to the system design, we present the results of a general survey of more than 400,000 spreadsheets we downloaded from the Web, giving a novel view of how users organize their data in spreadsheets.},

@article{Ko2011,
abstract = {Most programs today are written not by professional software developers, but by people with expertise in other domains working towards goals for which they need computational support. For example, a teacher might write a grading spreadsheet to save time grading, or an interaction designer might use an interface builder to test some user interface design ideas. Although these end-user programmers may not have the same goals as professional developers, they do face many of the same software engineering challenges, including understanding their requirements, as well as making decisions about design, reuse, integration, testing, and debugging. This article summarizes and classifies research on these activities, defining the area of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) and related terminology. The article then discusses empirical research about end-user software engineering activities and the technologies designed to support them. The article also addresses several crosscutting issues in the design of EUSE tools, including the roles of risk, reward, and domain complexity, and self-efficacy in the design of EUSE tools and the potential of educating users about software engineering principles.},

@inproceedings{Blackwell2002,
abstract = {Research into the cognitive aspects of programming originated in the study of professional programmers (whether experts or students). Even "end-user" programmers in previous studies have often worked in organizations where programming is recognized to be demanding professional work-the term "power-user" recognizes this technical kudos. But as personal computers become widespread, and most new domestic appliances incorporate microprocessors, many people are engaging in programming-like activities in domestic or nonprofessional contexts. Such users often have less motivation and more obstacles to programming, meaning that they may be unlikely even to take the first steps. This paper analyses the generic nature of those first steps, and identifies the cognitive demands that characterize them. On the basis of this analysis the paper proposes the attention investment model, a cognitive model of programming that offers a consistent account of all programming behaviour, from professionals to end-users.},

Individuals and businesses use spreadsheets for a wide variety of applications, ranging from performing simple calculations to building complex financial models. In this article, we first discuss how spreadsheet programs are actually functional programs. We then describe concepts in spreadsheet programming, followed by a brief history of spreadsheet systems. Widespread use of spreadsheets, coupled with their high error-proneness and the impact of spreadsheet errors, has motivated research into techniques aimed at the prevention, detection, and correction of errors in spreadsheets. We present an overview of research effort that seeks to rectify this problem.},

abstract = {We present a study investigating the performance of a system for automatically inferring spreadsheet templates. These templates allow users to safely edit spreadsheets, that is, certain kinds of errors such as range, reference, and type errors can be provably prevented. Since the inference of templates is inherently ambiguous, such a study is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of any such automatic system. The study results show that the system considered performs significantly better than subjects with intermediate to expert level programming expertise. These results are important because the translation of the huge body of existing spreadsheets into a system based on safety-guaranteeing templates cannot be performed without automatic support. We also carried out post-hoc analyses of the video recordings of the subjects' interactions with the spreadsheets and found that although expert-level subjects needed less time and developed more accurate templates than less experienced subjects, they did not inspect fewer cells in the spreadsheet. \%and found that expert-level subjects spend less time and inspect fewer cells in the spreadsheet and develop more accurate templates than subjects with less experience.},
